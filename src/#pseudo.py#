- count the number of incoming edges for each node. O(n+e)
- put each node with 0 incoming edges in a set S. O(n)
- while S has nodes:
- take a node n from S.
- delete n and update the number of incoming edges of the nodes connected to n. if any of those nodes now have 0 incoming edges, put them in S.
- endwhile O(n+e)
- if S is empty put there are still nodes left, you have cycle.
