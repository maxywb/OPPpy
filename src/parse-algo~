Operator Precedence Parsing

Having precedence relations allows to identify handles as follows:[7]

    scan the string from left until seeing •>
    scan backwards (from right to left) over any =• until seeing <•
    everything between the two relations <• and •>, including any intervening or surrounding nonterminals, forms the handle

It is generally not necessary to scan the entire sentential form to find the handle.

Initialize: Set ip to point to the first symbol of w$
Repeat:
  If $ is on the top of the stack and ip points to $ then return
  else
    Let a be the top terminal on the stack, and b the symbol pointed to by ip
    if a <• b or a =• b then
      push b onto the stack
      advance ip to the next input symbol
    else if a •> b then
      repeat
        pop the stack
      until the top stack terminal is related by <• to the terminal most recently popped
    else error()
  end
